This adds a freecad package to the site-packages and give the possibility to import FreeCAD with:

```python
from freecad import app
```

**TODO:** add other namespaces too.

```python
from freecad import app
from freecad import sketcher
from freecad import part
...
```

In the long run we might find another way to achieve this.
